# Device Lab

A React app used to queue up web pages to be tested at the Device Lab (A wall of different mobile phones and tablets). It allows you to easily pull up web pages for testing without having to manually type in the address for each page.

- It uses Firbase/Firestore for a database.
- There's also a React Chrome Extension that is required in order to send pages to the Device Lab. You can view it here.
